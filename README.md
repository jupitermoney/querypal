# Querypal

Querypal is a web-based, query execution tool which leverages Amazon Athena to make authoring queries and retrieving results simple for users. 
Querypal provides the ability to find tables, see metadata, browse sample rows, write and edit queries, then submit queries all in a web interface. 
Once queries are running, users can track query progress and when finished, get the results back through the browser as a table.

### Features  
- Fully serverless and can be hosted as an Amazon S3 static website.
- Authentication is managed by Amazon Cognito and can be customized.
- Table explorer to visualize schema of table and first 1000 rows.
- Syntax highlighting
- Global Query Timeline: The query timeline allows users to share queries with their colleagues. Shared queries 
are visible to all users and can help speed up analysis. 


### TODOs

- VueJS
- AWS Amplify
- Yarn package manager
- See project setup below


## Deployment
To deploy the infrastructure and code, you'll need an AWS account and a correctly [configured AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with enough 
permissions to create the architecture below (Administrator rights are recommended).
```shell script
bash ./deploy.sh -p <aws_profile> -r <aws_region> 
```

Before executing the shell command above, it is required that you provide a [GitHub Access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
that will be used to create a webhook and read-only deploy key by AWS Amplify. This token should be stored in your [AWS SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) 
with the key `/Querypal/Amplify/GitHubToken`.

All arguments to the `deploy.sh` script are optional. The default AWS profile and region are used if none are provided.

The script will:
1. Create a CloudFormation stack named `querypal-web-ui` holding the following: 
    - AWS Amplify App for Querypal
    - IAM Service to be assumed by AWS Amplify for managing deployments
    - SSM Parameter containing the AWS Amplify App ID which will be used later
2. Deploy an AWS Amplify UI and monitor the job
3. Print out Querypal AWS Amplify Default Domain URL.

The initial deployment can take 10-15 minutes. The same command can be used for both creating and updating infrastructure.
